# train-time

Summary: Simple train schedule app ot practice using external databses

Link to deployed project: https://joeyvon2434.github.io/train-time/

Purpose: This page was created to practice using external databases with real time data updates on multiple screens

Instructions: Input values for new trains and watch as the schedule updates

Technical Approach: Populate index.html file with prepetual elements, including the input fields and the blank schedule
table. Use Javascript with JQuery and AJAX to send information to firebase, read out the updated inputs, and create the
necessary table elements for each new train. Moment.JS was used for time conversion and math.

Getting Started: Load index.html, or go to the link above.
